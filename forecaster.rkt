;;; Forecaster, by Alex Reinhart
;;;
;;; Weather websites all suck. Deliver the forecast in plain text instead.
;;;
;;; Pull forecast data from the National Weather Service API, and give
;;; plain-language descriptions of the forecast. The NWS alerts and forecast
;;; descriptions are usually more honest than commercial sites, since they (a)
;;; can admit forecast uncertainty, (b) have no incentive to forecast dramatic
;;; events to get clicks, and (c) give straightforward descriptions instead of
;;; hyperbolic news stories about Winter Storm Hades.
;;;
;;; Provides functions to format the forecast as plain text or as a plain-text
;;; email, which could be delivered once or twice a day.
